Tuple :
         Tuples are used to store multiple items in single variable.
         It is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable and also allow duplicate values.
         They are written with round brackets().



Difference:


                             	           LIST	                                                                                    TUPLE
1	                   Lists are mutable	                                                                           Tuples are immutable
2	     The implication of iterations is Time-consuming	                      The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3	   The list is better for performing operations,                                               Tuple data type is appropriate for 
                              such as insertion and deletion                                                                 accessing the elements.	                                             
4	        Lists consume more memory	                                                    Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
5	        Lists have several built-in methods	                                    Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
