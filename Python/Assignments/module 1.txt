1. What is Python?

Ans- Python is a new generation language. It is widely used general purpose high level programming language.
        It was designed by "Guido van Rossum" in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation.
* It works quickly and integrate system more efficiently.
* Its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
* It is an interpreted, object-oriented, high - level programming language with dynamic semantics.
* Its high - level built in data structures combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding nake it very attractive for Rapid Application Development.
* It supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
* It is interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source.


2. Why did you choose Python?

Ans- I chose Python because:

* Designed to be easy to learn and master
- Clean and Clear syntax
- Very few keywords

* Highly portable
- Runs almost anywhere - high end servers and workstations, down to windows CE
- Uses machine independent byte - code

* Extensible
- Designed to be extensible using C / C++, allowing access to many external libraries

* Clean syntax plus high - level data types
- Leads to fast coding (1st language in universities)

* Uses white - space to delimit blocks

* Variables do not need declaration

* Reduced development time
- Code is 2*10x shorter than C , C++, Java

* Improved program maintenance
- Code is extremely readable

* Less trainig
- Language is very easy to learn


3. What is Software?

Ans- Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.
         It is a term used to refer to application, scripts and programs that run on a device.


4. What is programming?

Ans- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. 
        It can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.
